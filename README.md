## About ##
 
**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a classic pencil and paper game, which involves 2 players each taking a turn marking Xs and Os on a 
3 by 3 grid, with the objective of the markings creating a line (either diagonal, horizontal, or vertical). 

Includes both a terminal version, and a GUI version made using Swing.
